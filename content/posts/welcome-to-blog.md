## About me

Hi! I'm Sully, and welcome to my blog! I am a DevOps Engineer with a former background in software engineering and academia. I am well known for my iconic salmon blazer:

## Purpose of my Blog

The purpose of this blog is to share my overall journey as to how I got to where I am right now, as well as share some of the things that I'm currently working on. I also plan to share my perspective on certain topics surrounding IT in general.

## So.. what exactly will I be focusing on?

A lot of my blog will primarily encompass discussion around:

* DevOps - top to bottom
* Infrastructure as Code with Terraform, Bicep, ARM, etc
* Mobile Development SDKS (Flutter, Nativescript, etc)
* General Automation, QA specifically
* Random thoughts ðŸ˜‰ but mostly tech focused.

I'm sure this list will grow as I keep moving forward, but stay tuned for more things to come! ðŸ™‚
