<p>Hi! I&rsquo;m Sully, and welcome to my blog! I am a DevOps Engineer with a former background in software engineering and academia. I am well known for my iconic salmon blazer:</p>

<h2 id="purpose-of-my-blog">Purpose of my Blog</h2>
<p>The purpose of this blog is to share my overall journey as to how I got to where I am right now, as well as share some of the things that I&rsquo;m currently working on. I also plan to share my perspective on certain topics surrounding IT in general.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-exactly-will-i-be-focusing-on">So.. what exactly will I be focusing on?</h2>
<p>A lot of my blog will primarily encompass discussion around:</p>
<ul>
<li>DevOps - top to bottom</li>
<li>Infrastructure as Code with Terraform, Bicep, ARM, etc</li>
<li>Mobile Development SDKS (Flutter, Nativescript, etc)</li>
<li>General Automation, QA specifically</li>
<li>Random thoughts ðŸ˜‰ but mostly tech focused.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure this list will grow as I keep moving forward, but stay tuned for more things to come! ðŸ™‚</p>
